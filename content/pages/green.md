Greenness
==========
Server consolidation in IaaS datacenters allows for energy savings by reducing the number of servers that need to remain switched on. Some cloud management middleware have support for this feature. Such support is crucial for large datacenters.

When fogbow is used to deploy an IaaS cloud using shared desktops, the number of nodes can be very high. This is also a setting for which some green IT approach is crucial, since if these desktops were not to be used in the cloud, they would probably be switched off.
