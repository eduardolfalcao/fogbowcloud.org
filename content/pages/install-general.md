# General Installation

You can install the fogbow components according to your interest. For example, if you have a nova-compute installed and want to make it an oportunistic component, you can follow instruction [here](http://www.fogbowcloud.org/install-opportunism). Otherwise, if you want to install only a cloud manager to be part of a existing federation, you can see [here](http://www.fogbowcloud.org/install-manager). But if you want to install a new federation, you need to install the rendezvous and the managers (you can see how to install these components [here](http://www.fogbowcloud.org/install-rendezvous) and [here](http://www.fogbowcloud.org/install-manager) respectively).
