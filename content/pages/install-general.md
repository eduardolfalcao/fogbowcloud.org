# Get started

Fogbow can be used in several use cases. Learn how to install it for some cases that follow on.

## I want to join a fogbow federation

If you have a private cloud running, and you want to be part of an existing federation, you need to install a fogbow Manager and configure it properly, so that it is able to communicate with your existing cloud. You can learn how to install and configure a fogbow Manager in [here](http://www.fogbowcloud.org/install-manager).

## I want to deploy a fogbow federation myself

If you want to install a new federation, you need to install an instance of the Rendezvous component and a Manager component in every Administrative Domain you control. And then, of course, you need to point every Manager to the same Rendezvous. You can learn how to install a fogbow Rendezvous [here](http://www.fogbowcloud.org/install-rendezvous).

## I want to make my cloud opportunistic

If you have a private cloud running Openstack, therefore running nova-compute in your compute nodes, and you want to make it oportunistic, in a sense that only idle nodes will show up to the cloud , you can follow the instructions in [here](http://www.fogbowcloud.org/install-opportunism).
