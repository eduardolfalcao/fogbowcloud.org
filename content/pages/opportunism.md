Opportunism
==========
Opportunism is a feature that allows idle resources to be used by the cloud. Resources being used by a local user shouldnâ€™t show up to the cloud.

### Requirements
* nova-compute should be disabled and its instances killed when there is mouse/keyboard activity.
* it must come back when the host is idle for a certain amount of time.

### Implementation
The opportunism is implemented using PowerNap that is a configurable deamon that executes some actions when the system is idle, and the idleness is determined by monitors that can be configured to watch CPU load, processes, mouse/keyboard, etc.

A powernap action script needs to be written sends an RPC to nova-compute in order to disable it.
